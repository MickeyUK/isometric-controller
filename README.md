# Isometric Controller

A simple isometric controller and camera you can use as a basis for an isometric game in Unity. Uses the outlined diffuse shader [here](http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/Silhouette-Outlined_Diffuse) for the 'x-ray' effect.

You can view a demo of the controller [here](https://mickeyuk.github.io/projects/isometric-controller)!
